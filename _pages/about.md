Welcome to my homepage! 👋  

I am a **[Ph.D. student](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00183866)** at **KU Leuven**, Belgium, in the ESAT–ADVISE group (supervised by **[Prof. Jeffery Prinzie](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00093261)**).  
My current research focuses on embedded FPGA (eFPGA) and SoC architectures, with a special emphasis on CERN readout and data processing circuits.  

Before joining KU Leuven, I received my M.Phil. in Microelectronics in 2025 from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), supervised by **[Prof. Renjing Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Mu__bJEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)** and **[Prof. Zhongrui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ofl3nUsAAAAJ&hl=en)**. I obtained my B.Eng. in Microelectronics in 2023 from Harbin Institute of Technology, and conducted a **remote research internship** in 2022 at The University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of **[Prof. Zhongrui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ofl3nUsAAAAJ&hl=en)**.  

My interests include:
- eFPGA architecture design  
- Reconfigurable computing and SoC integration  
- Hardware acceleration for data acquisition and reconstruction systems (CERN)  
- Memristor-based Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architecture design  

I am always open to discussions and collaborations — feel free to reach out!
